Deer meat was his main food.
And he ate plants. Plants, or "herbs" as the white men call them, he ate them.
He wouldn't eat too much so as not to get tired or get out of breath: because wolves were swift.
They (the wolves) move their feet fast, but they don't run.
The young man was swift on [all] fours like wolves.
He kept us with them (the wolf pack).
[In the pack] there were four [wolves] in the front and also eight [behind] — they put him (the young man) in the center of the pack.
He reached the tip of the island (= Vancouver Island) and the mountain range, and then they came back to the starting point, following the same route.
And then they went back to places where the young man lived, Otsosat and _w̓apuukḥ_.
They went down to the inlet to Clayoquot.
All the bands had heard about them.
They reached the [other] tip of the isle, to Nitinaht.
The only time they stopped was when it got dark.
They travled along mountain ranges, steep hills, steep valleys, and vertical cliffs.
The wolves traveled and could see high peaks far, far away.
Then the moon began to wax (the new moon cycle had begun): Full Moon, you could say; the moon was perfectly round.
They didn't have to stop for long distances.
The journey had been continuing for a long time. And it had been four months [since they had departed].
They traveled along the coast for four months.
Then they made stops at places where there was a big lake.
The young man was given a heart of a deer to eat, and he drank deer blood.
Each time he was fed first, and then the wolves ate.
The wolves would stop by the shoreline of a like, a big lake.
When the wolves hunted, they sent the ones that ran fastest.
It didn't take them long to catch a deer and kill it, or 'put it to sleep'.
Don't say "kill".
Never say "kill" when you kill animals.
It is the same with mammals. Never say "kill".
Say "You become tame!" or "I will make you tame."
Wolves would say that lisping.
"_ʔuʔiič̓eepiks_, _ʔuʔiič̓eepiks_" — that is how wolves would talk.
They are unlike us who speak properly as "_ʔuʕiičiʔatikqs_".
We will say, "_ʔuʕiičiʔatikqs_."
And wolves lisp like "_ʔuʔiič̓eetiks_, _ʔuʔiič̓eetiks_."
The wolves sound as if they are lisping.
Now they departed.
They went to a seaside village called Ohiat and stayed there for quite a while.
[And] the chief and everybody — every member of every household in the village — heard them [howling and singing].
They heard him (the wolves) and got afraid because the wolves were strange, making strange noise when they howled.
They sounded like this for four times: _woo_.
This is how they sounded and they did it four times.
"It's very strange," they said.
They knew that the young man had a name (the young man had been initiated).
The young man had changed, getting swift in action, and he didn't have any serious competition [against him].
[When he ran in the woods] it was as if he ran through bushes.
Tree branches [that would obstruct the path] would get out of his way.
So would the windfalls — they would move out of their way.
The same with the thickets — they would be folded down on the ground.
Trees, too, are bent all the way down to the ground [with their tops touching the ground].
He could see the other side of the channel.
It was very close to this place where we are now, Victoria.
Makah was very close [to Victoria].
[But] it has changed and now we are far apart [from Makah]. Something extraordinary happened.
Nitinahts could hear them.
Many Nitinaht people knew about their predecessors and this story — or mythology, as white men call it now.
A long, long time ago, things were accurate.
He returned all the way along the same trail.
The very best hunters were trying to catch him.
They spotted him when he came out of the woods.
They threw spears at him (the young man) but couldn't get direct hits: some just glanced off.
This [referring to the upper arm] is where his car was. It was a big scar.
They almost made a direct hit and captured him [but were not successful after all].
Now, one year had passed.
People said "one day" [when they meant "one year"] a long time ago.
_n̓upqʔičḥ_ is "one year": It's equal to one year.
_n̓upčiiɬ_ is "one day".
They had come all the way back to the spot behind the Opnit village.
It was not high over the hill, it couldn't be that high up — like three hundred feet high.
They (people in the Big House) were surrounded by the wolves.
They were also at the creek.
Wolves were there so that people could not get water.
They (village people) were all prepared [for the return of the wolves].
People knew that they (wolves and the young man) would return to the village according to the moon.
It was at the beginning of the new moon cycle (when the moon is crescent): the same time as they left.
At the beginning of a new year, which white men call December, they came back.
The chiefs sang songs and beat their drums.
It became daylight on the fourth day.
[In the fireplace in the Big House], There were no flames — only sparks.
There was something extraordinary about the fire.
The knot [burning in the fireplace] was still showing flashes [even after a long time].
The knot appeared to be the same all the time — it only showed little flashes — or flames, you could say.
The knots remained the same in the fireplace.
They could barely recognize people sitting together in the Big House — however big the house was.
Right here in the house there was fire, burning. {GL indicated the position by drawing a picture.}
In the house there was one door right here. {GL indicated the position by drawing a picture.}
They had eight people on top of the house as lookouts.
The wolves would circle around the house four times.
Now, they went into the woods.
Now, it became daylight on the fourth day.
The wolves crawled out of the woods to the rocky point.
The best hunters were there, coming from everywhere.
The hunters threw spears and they aimed their spears at his shoulder.
Spears might have [penetrated his skin and] scraped his bone [but they didn't make any serious damage on the bone].
[Whenever the young man got wounded,] the wolves immediately licked the wound.
It seems as though they had medicine.
[Then] It (his wound) stopped bleeding, and it didn't even swell.
They (wolves) were having problems [with responding to the attack against them] being in the canoe. It was difficult.
The wolves jumped into the water.
People tried to club the wolves, but the wolves would bite the clubs and take them away.
People captured him (the young man).
They started the ritual all over again.
They didn't know where those wolves had gone in the woods.
Again they howled four times.
_woo_ _woo_ _woo_ _woo_ — this is how they sounded.
The young man was taken away.
"Listen," the elder said, "Do not tell whatever they have done to you to anybody for one year. You will be away for one year."
The young man was taken away so that he could not do anything [that ordinary people can do].
They put him (the young man) into a cell, like a cubicle like this. This was how his sleeping place looked. {with a picture}
He only went in and out through this hole. {with a picture}
Sometimes he would go out hunting and get two hairseals in his canoe.
He only ate blubber and plants that he was fed by the wolves.
Now there was medicine — eight bundles of medicine.
Eight kinds.
These medicines were small — these herbs, eight bundles.
Now, it became the next year and they were having their Wolf Ceremony.
He told his people that he had been captured by wolves and had been taken to far distant places — way over there to the end of the coast.
Then during the Wolf Ceremony, they announced that he had been taken away to Checleset, to Machalat, to Nuchalath, and there to the land on the other shore.
Manhousats were close to Toquaht, Ucluelet, and Ohiat.
They are close to us.
Also Nitinat [are close]. There are many relatives. All the way down to Neah Bay there are our relatives.
[We are all related] thanks to whatever happened to the young man.
[And] thanks to women [who got married and left for these places] — or the chiefs who have these daughters.
When a daughter gets her husband, she leaves the chief's place (her father) [for the village of her husband]. (= A girl gets married, leaving him, the chief.)
On the other hand, when a young man gets his wife, [his delegates] go to the chief who has a daughter. (= On the other hand, a young man proposes by going to the chief who has a daughter.)
[They do that] so that their name will not be lost.
[They do that] so that so-called 'title' will not be lost.
[They do that so that] what we know [will not be lost].
This is the way with the chiefs — four chiefs.
There are four [chiefs] in total.
Well, that is what happened.
The Manhousat people never harmed wolves. Never.
This also happened to me when I was young.
I was bathing.
I was taking along the dog I had before, whose name as Adanac.
There he was sitting on the ground while I was bathing.
There was something wrong with the dog.
He came right close to me but I did not let go of my herbs.
There the wolf jumped over the rotten log — windfalls on the round.
The wolf was watching me.
There was something strange about his ear — it was like this [the ear was down]. {with a picture}
"I will not harm you," I said.
I was naked then.
The wolf went back very slowly and jumped over.
_xemc_, _xemc_, _xemc_.
