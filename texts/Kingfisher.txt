This happened a long time ago.
They sailed into the bay of Maaqtusiis.
There probably was a little wind, blowing towards the land.
They came into the bay one day.
We also call it (the bay) "hitac̓u".
They went to Maaqtusiis — [to be exact,] _wiiḥaaqsusiis_.
The schooner reached _wiiḥaaqsusiis_ and dropped anchor.
It (the schooner) was not so big.
There were two crewmen, or there could have been three, on the ship.
Some people went out to meet them (the people on the schooner).
The first ones to go out were the bravest ones, the ones with strong minds.
Many white men could understand Chinook Jargon.
Some of them spoke Chinook Jargon.
They got theirs (= their knowledge of Chinook Jargon) from Hudson Bay Company.
Among the first ones that [learned to] understand the language might have been the Captain who was taking command of the ship.
They (white men) dropped anchor.
They said [to the people of the village], "We want to get fur,
the fur of sea mammals there from the ocean,
fur of fur-bearing animals up in the woods."
Then they (native people) went out to meet them (European traders) and traded sea otters and various kinds of land otters.
[And] some had bear skin [to trade] — we call bear hide _ƛ̓itḥaq_.
The native people sold what they had, whatever they owned.
At first they were friendly; the white men were friendly.
They (native people) were served water.
The water tasted strange.
And sometimes they were given tea to drink.
White men had many biscuits — we call them "one-that-looks-like-a-Sand-Dollar".
They [native people] went out repeatedly to meet white people and were given whatever they traded for.
They called it _twiidin_.
Some of the white people understood it as 'trading post' when they (Indian people) said _twiidin_.
Then a couple that came from outside the village went out to meet them [to trade].
They had sea otter hides.
My grandmother didn't tell me [what they had for trade].
She only mentioned that there was a couple on the ship.
[When the Captain saw the couple,] he suddenly acted strangely.
As they (white men) took them (the man and the wife) on board the ship, they took the husband and the wife to different places.
The man was suspicious.
He was only given some kind of blanket. Some blankets.
She (my grandmother who told me the story) didn't tell me. This is all she said.
[He got] blankets, pants and other things.
This is how pants were long ago.
A high-ranking leader, i.e., captain of the ship, would sometimes dress up [in his uniform].
The woman came out crying.
"Hurry! Get in the canoe! Now!" she said to her husband. They got in the canoe and left.
They went into the bay — the bay that we call _kʷispaa_.
It is the place across the hill from Maaqtusiis.
They went into the bay.
This story gets nasty from here on.
Although they (Ahousaht people) were friendly [toward English people] at first, [when they heard of the incident] they got angry and made a mistake.
We say _wičsiɬaʔaš_ "they made a mistake".
Suddenly the native people got angry.
They left in their canoes.
They made a mistake.
For some time the warriors were gone, attacking them (English people).
"We have sunk their ship! We have sunk their ship!" they said as they enter the bay of Maaqtusiis.
"It (the English Navy ship) sank into the water! The ship sank!"
The canoe was loaded with some kind of clothes [they took from the ship].
The schooner sank.
It sank at _wiiḥaaqsusiis_.
Then they went out to the open sea to _n̓uʕasaqḥ_, Ahous, or _hit:qƛis_. (?)
Chetarpe was their home village.
Chetarpe was the place where they (Ahousaht people) had their summer camp for fishing. And so did Kelsomats.
We call Kelsomats "people from outside".
[Although they had the camp there with the Ahousahts,] the Kelsomat didn't take part in the business of the Ahousaht band.
They (Ahousahts) killed all the crewmen on the schooner.
Soon after the incident a canoe came to the beach of Ahous.
Makah people came from Neah Bay to invite the village for a feast.
And they (Ahousahts) left home in their canoes.
They sailed on a westerly wind.
They only time you can quickly get there (Neah Bay) is when a westerly wind is blowing. On the way back, a southeast wind.
After some time [of traveling on the ocean they finally got there, and] Ahousaht people partook in a feast.
An [Ahousaht] man made a mistake: he was dressed up in the Admiral's clothing.
He was sitting there in the house.
A [Makah] man spotted it.
The schooer was missing.
They spotted it and recognized the clothing of the dead Englishman.
[We called Englishmen] "King George man" no matter who was the king of England at that time.
Europeans are called "people from overseas".
That's how my late grandmother by the name of _kʷaatya_, or Annie, used to call them.
Her father was Wiikinanish.
This was how (in this kind of posture) my grandmother _kʷaatya_ used to tell me stories.
She didn't smile at all [while telling this story, although sometimes she smiled telling other stories]. Her face was really serious.
Because they did an improper thing.
It became the next day and they gathered again in the house for a feast.
"My relatives, leave the village!"
He (Makah man) recognized the thing he was wearing and said to the Ahousaht man.
"Depart when it gets dark."
So they (Ahousaht people) left in canoes.
Now it was really dark.
They kept paddling.
They were just right in time for the [favorable] wind to start blowing.
It might have been close to midnight.
They were sailing.
They got to Ahous Point just in time. They were singing [a paddling song].
"I am in serious trouble," he (the one who was wearing the Admiral's uniform) said.
"We are in serious trouble. There is bad news," he said.
"Move into the inlets," he said [to the people in the village].
[And] they all headed for the inlets.
Maybe it was in September, since many people were making dried salmon [in the village].
The Ahousahts went to Atheo River, Pretty Girl Cove, and the Magin River area.
Wahous was the base summer camp from the Ahousahts.
This is where the late _kapčaa_, a.k.a. _kapčuk_, lived.
_kapčuk_ was a chief and owned everything along the mountains.
You people today call it 'Nuu-chah-nulth'.
Chiefs took it (the ownership within their territories) seriously.
Everything along the mountains belongs to one [i.e., the chief].
They (British Navy) arrived.
Opetchesaht people heard about their arrival.
The British Navy anchored at Tofino [which is just across from the Opetchesaht area].
They were going to invade the Ahousaht people. There was going to be nobody left.
There were two Indian people among them (the British).
They went to Wahous.
They (Ahousaht people) saw the (the British Navy) coming into the bay very clearly.
The villagers crowded around, looking at them curiously.
Suddenly they (the British Navy) were shooting at the village people.
They got scared and fled in all directions.
People fled into the woods.
_qaaḥma_ was there.
_qaaḥma_ was young.
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, he could have been eighteen years old. Or [maybe] twenty.
_qaaḥma_ was young.
He wasn't scared.
The British Navy sailed out for the river.
There is a little island [at the mouth of] the so-called Trout River.
He ran over the hill to the other side of the island.
They (the British soldiers) ran after him (_qaaḥma_).
His child's name was _qaaḥma_ [Big Paul] {_qaaḥma_'s child was named after him}, a.k.a. _sa:ʕaʔa:ɬ_ {his family/ancestor's name}.
_qaaḥma_ dove into the water. Chuq!
They (the British solders) shot at him.
Sixty-two — that is the number of bullets they used to shoot him.
The only thing that came up to the surface was a blanket.
It was floating in the sea. They shot at the blanket again [although there was nothing else but a blanket].
He (_qaaḥma_) dove. Chuq!
He dove [really quick] just like a land otter or a mink.
The rocky point [he was heading for] was far.
That land, slough, was quite far.
_qaaḥma_ knew every inch of the river.
He picked up and held a stone in his hands.
You can move fast [under the water] when you hold rocks in your hands [as ballast] and kick [the bottom of the river to move forward].
He went into a slough.
They (the British soldiers) were on the rock {the Napnit area}.
"I picked out the right one," [_qaaḥma_ said.]
It was probably over a quarter mile if you measure: he dove through twelve hundred feet if you measure it.
They were long-winded.
Native people used to be long-winded.
Not all of them were long-winded.
_qaaḥma_ ran into the woods.
They (the British) missed their shots at him (_qaaḥma_).
He didn't get hurt. He was alive.
He was alive.
He ran over there to the foot of the mountain.
[Then] he went a little further.
"Now, we will go across the hill," said the Clayoquot man.
"It is close across to Whitepine Cove."
The British people walked over and got there when the native people — probably uncles of _yuxsitk_ (Big Jackson) — were there [= British people caught native people being there].
_yuxsitk_'s ancestor was married to my grandmother _kʷaatya_.
The Clayoquot man came into the house when they were eating.
They broke into pieces all the boxes and whatever [valuable things] they kept in their chests.
The Clayoquot man only took dried salmon.
"Where is he," they asked them, mentioning his name, "Where is _kapčaa_."
Then they said, "We don't know where he would be."
The British soldiers went back over the hill when it got dark.
They completely demolished all of their (native people's) houses and killed off the people.
They split up all of the canoes. They split them in half.
The Indian man [who happened to be away from the village] came at the right moment [for the favorable tide] and got into the inlet.
There was one canoe left.
He was watching at the point what the white men were doing.
He landed on the beach.
The native people hid all over the place.
He went there — it's called _ʕiiʕiiɬmak̓ʷas_.
Here the current goes in and out [as the tide changes].
He got there just in time for the high tide. {One can only go through the channel when the tide is high.}
He hid over there up river.
This is a little creek. {GL indicated the position by drawing a map.} He hid there.
He went back to Chetarpe.
He and many other people lived in Chetarpe.
They were shooting repeatedly [to give signals] and landed on the beach.
They split up canoes.
There was a post, a totem pole, standing on the beach which they called Standing-Up-At-The-Center-Of-The-House.
[On the pole] there was [the crest which has] one child in front held in arms.
They probably set fire to the house.
The houses burned down.
There were none left. None.
They (villagers) ran into the woods headed for Maaqtusiis, the place they call Ahousat.
The kept shooting: bam, bam.
"I'm not going. You all get out of here and go into the woods," he (one of the old people) said to the people.
Only the very old man remained on the beach.
He heard and saw whatever they (the British people) were doing.
They demolished all the houses, killed everybody, and broke all the canoes into pieces or split them in half.
And they captured _miimixt_. _miimixt_ was a small boy.
And [they] also [captured] another one called _čuuwin_ — he also had an Indian name, _čuuwin_.
The two were taken into captivity.
The child (_miimixt_) was _kapčaa_'s son.
They (the British soldiers) went back [to the Tofino area].
The Clayoquot man came on board again.
He recognized the Ahousaht boy.
They went back to Tofino.
They were at Tofino.
The Clayoquots went [in their canoes] out to sea to meet the British soldiers.
They recognized _miimixt_.
I (GL) knew the man by the name of _miimixt_.
His [other] name was Keitlah, or _kiɬamaxin_.
The Clayoquot chief — who is a descendant of the chief is called Chief Joseph, a.k.a. Maquinna — he took the boy with him. He took _miimixt_.
[The Clayoquot chief tried to take _čuuwin_, too, but] _čuuwin_ got scared [and kept eluding the Clayoquot chief].
The very old man was also taken. He was very old and alone.
"I am an old man. I don't care [what happens to me]," he said.
Young _čuuwin_ felt brave thanks to him [the old man].
They took him.
"I was brave. They made me drink tabacco [and I was brave enough to actually drink it]," the old man used to say.
It was probably tea that he was served. He had tea.
This native man thought he was given chewing tobacco [when he saw tea leaves at the bottom of his cup].
"They must have been trying to kill me," he used to say.
Sometimes the tea was sweet.
Maybe they gave him white sugar or something like brown sugar when he drank the tea.
They left for Victoria.
They departed.
I could say "sailed away".
The British people were sailing away — maybe on a steam boat. It was probably a steam boat.
They called British Navy soldiers "_pitiš_". They couldn't say "British".
The person on the throne and his descendants were called "King George" recently — early 1920's.
Native people used to say "We are King George people".
We have the Union Jack. They gave native people the flag.
They were also really excited [about the flag].
The former chief Benson, _kapčaa_ had one. He was also given the Union Jack.
He had a sword, too.
Nobody knows whatever happened to the sword. _č̓it̓u:ɬ_ — this is how they called it.
The [old] man was gone for a long time. He went to Victoria for a long time.
They took him back as far as Tofino and dropped him off there.
He told his people about the way they treated him.
He thought they were going to kill him [by making him drink tobacco] although they only served him tea.
And sometimes whatever they served him had a really strong (bitter) taste.
Because the only thing British Navy soldiers had was liquor, i.e. rum — Indian people called it "_nam_".
They used to serve him the hard thing — we called it Thing-Resembling-Sand-Dollar — it was probably biscuits.
They used to serve him salty things — salty meat.
Probably he was served salt pork.
This actually happened. It was probably a woman — a female body was split right in half.
Her innards were scattered all over on the side.
She was a very old woman. She was split right in half from here — from her private part [toward her head].
And also her head was shattered. It was smashed open.
They clubbed her.
For a long time, they never again traded sea otters or anything with them (Europeans).
They didn't [trade with Europeans any more]. They gave up [trading with Europeans].
They only traded with other people.
And the native man on board the Kingfisher was also killed [by the Ahousaht warriors who attacked the ship].
One [of the warriors] wanted to save the native man's life.
[But] they (the warriors) killed them (people on board the Kingfisher) all.
They (the warriors who opposed the idea of saving the native person on board the Kingfisher) said to him (the one who wanted to save the native person's life), "we may have some trouble in the future [if we keep him alive]." But they were already in trouble [by killing the Englishmen on the ship].
This is what happened.
They made a mistake.
