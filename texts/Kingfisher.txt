This happened a long time ago.
They sailed into the bay of Maaqtusiis.
There probably was a little wind, blowing towards the land.
They came into the bay one day.
We also call it (the bay) "hitac̓u".
They went to Maaqtusiis — [to be exact,] _wiiḥaaqsusiis_.
The schooner reached _wiiḥaaqsusiis_ and dropped anchor.
It (the schooner) was not so big.
There were two crewmen, or there could have been three, on the ship.
Some people went out to meet them (the people on the schooner).
The first ones to go out were the bravest ones, the ones with strong minds.
Many white men could understand Chinook Jargon.
Some of them spoke Chinook Jargon.
They got theirs (= their knowledge of Chinook Jargon) from Hudson Bay Company.
Among the first ones that [learned to] understand the language might have been the Captain who was taking command of the ship.
They (white men) dropped anchor.
They said [to the people of the village], "We want to get fur,
the fur of sea mammals there from the ocean,
fur of fur-bearing animals up in the woods."
Then they (native people) went out to meet them (European traders) and traded sea otters and various kinds of land otters.
[And] some had bear skin [to trade] — we call bear hide _ƛ̓itḥaq_.
The native people sold what they had, whatever they owned.
At first they were friendly; the white men were friendly.
They (native people) were served water.
The water tasted strange.
And sometimes they were given tea to drink.
